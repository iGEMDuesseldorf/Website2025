## Today’s bioproduction is expensive, inaccessible and unreliable.
Let’s play a riddle: what is in your birthday cake, the clothes you wear, and the medication you take? The answer is molecules made through bioproduction. Bioproduction is powerful, but it rarely runs smoothly. The production of these molecules is not as easy and reliable as it could be: the productivity is unstable, as metabolic bottlenecks prevent constant outputs. Further intermediates and by-products accumulate because feedback control in cells is limited, especially for complex, multi-step pathways. It is hard to fine-tune expression levels in complex pathways, since even minor imbalances can derail the entire metabolic flux. The consequence is a high metabolic burden for the producing cells, forcing them to use large amounts of energy and resources away from growth and maintenance. In practice, this means that the very cells we rely on for production become less efficient over time, which limits yields and, consequently, profits. Further, the hardware required to study and optimize these processes is costly and complicated. This makes it inaccessible to many iGEM teams and smaller research groups. As a result, research is slowed down, datasets remain small and inconsistent, and true high-throughput optimization of bioproduction remains out of reach.
