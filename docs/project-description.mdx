## Today’s bioproduction is expensive, inaccessible and unreliable.

Let’s play a riddle: what is in your birthday cake, the clothes you wear, and the medication you take? The answer is molecules made through bioproduction. Bioproduction is powerful, but it rarely runs smoothly. The production of these molecules is not as easy and reliable as it could be: the productivity is unstable, as metabolic bottlenecks prevent constant outputs. Further intermediates and by-products accumulate because feedback control in cells is limited, especially for complex, multi-step pathways. It is hard to fine-tune expression levels in complex pathways, since even minor imbalances can derail the entire metabolic flux. The consequence is a high metabolic burden for the producing cells, forcing them to use large amounts of energy and resources away from growth and maintenance. In practice, this means that the very cells we rely on for production become less efficient over time, which limits yields and, consequently, profits. Further, the hardware required to study and optimize these processes is costly and complicated. This makes it inaccessible to many iGEM teams and smaller research groups. As a result, research is slowed down, datasets remain small and inconsistent, and true high-throughput optimization of bioproduction remains out of reach.

## STREAMlining bioproduction
With STREAM, we aim to solve these problems. We combine the construction of hardware and molecular ratiometric biosensors to stabilise the microbial production of biomolecules.

### Wetlab: Ratiometric Biosensor (link to result lab page)
We introduce the production pathway for the target molecule into the E.coli Marionette strain. To demonstrate our construct, we use two exemplary molecules: Kaempferol and Vanillin, although these can be replaced by other desired metabolites. To monitor the concentration of the produced molecule, we implement a transcription-based ratiometric biosensor, yielding a fluorescent output. If the output is very low, we can intervene by adding inducers of specific enzymatic steps, thereby overcoming bottlenecks. 

### Drylab: Modular machine-learning assisted chemostat (link to hardware page)
Our modular, sensor-integrated chemostat system enables continuous, automated control of microbial cultures. By maintaining cultures at steady state, the system ensures reproducible growth conditions while allowing fine control over the dilution rate, the key parameter that balances nutrient supply with culture growth. We integrate off-the-shelf sensors to monitor key variables with remote control tools. This allows constant oversight of cultures, early detection of deviations from normal growth patterns, and identification of optimal intervention points, all while keeping the costs minimal. Further, we support the hardware by an easy handable software, that lets you directly see and evaluate the measurements and of course adjust parameters.
The result is a bioreactor platform that supports long-term, reproducible experiments - without the need for expensive infrastructure and extensive manual labor. 

**Ratiometric Biosensor + Modular Chemostat = A match made in heaven** 

By integrating the biosensor with our chemostat, we create a closed-loop monitoring and control strategy. Based on the fluorescent output, the control algorithm calculates the optimal timepoints for intervention and thus stabilizing bioproduction and avoiding noisy oscillations in the concentration over time. Our approach achieves constant high output and yield of the end product,with no intermediate accumulation and reduced (toxic) by-product accumulation, resulting in reduced metabolic stress, fewer metabolic bottlenecks and an expanded bacterial lifespan.

STREAM demonstrates how accessible engineering can empower innovation in bioproduction.
